Hey there, lovely humans! Ever find yourself in a situation when everything feels a bit… meh? We've all been there. While journaling about your goals, daily happenings, or affirmations is fantastic, I stumbled upon a journaling superpower that totally upped my game.

For me, whenever I was in the thick of it – feeling overwhelmed, heartbroken, or just plain stuck – I’d grab my journal and dive deep. I’d ask myself: How am I truly feeling? Why am I feeling this way? And what can I do to shift things? This deep dive into my emotional landscape became my personal "aha!" moment factory. It helped me pinpoint those underlying fears and old traumas I didn’t even know were lurking. And guess what? Once you see them, you can start healing them!

Think of it as your personal detective agency. When something goes sideways, instead of letting your emotions run wild, just ask yourself: 
** How did this happen? 
** Why did it happen? And,
** What is this trying to teach me?

Write every detail, address every thought. Let's take an example to understand it better:

# Situation 1: You feel unworthy, ugly and a total failure because your crush didn't like you back

Ofcourse that's a tough situation to be in, and we may simply overthink all day, and doubt our capabilities. But using the above method, we can take control over the situation and ultimately win over it. I'll tell you how:
-- Asking "How did this happen?" - list down what all happened since the beginning. Say, you met this guy, what you liked about his personality? what made you realise that he's the one for you? how did you find he doesn't like you? did he give hints when you met or in your conversations? Write almost everything you can remember.
-- Then ask "Why did it happen?" - list down why are you calling yourself unworthy of love? Why do you think you are a failure? And are you actually a failure? (the answer to it is NO). Why are you overthinking about xyz decision? Believe me, you'll learn about yourself so much after this deep dive!
-- Now is the time to ask "What is this trying to teach me?" - it's the  most important question,so focus on the learnings, focus on what mistakes you shouldn't make in future. highlight your strengths, address your weaknesses by accepting and deciding that you can improve it.
-- Bonus step - focus on the things you're grateful for - like, your life, the day, the maturity of being able to handle such complex situations with ease etc

# Situation 2 : You're sad because you failed an important presentation at workplace
Well, quiet a common issue, but it shouldn't make you feel any less. You're a born winner, remember that! But yes, in the heat of the moment, you may not be able to process your thought well and analyse how to proceed further, so apply the above method.
-- Ask "How did this happen? - list down, what all happened since the beginning. Say, you walked in the conference hall, you took your seat, got the setup ready, mention the technical faults or glitches if any. Did you go nervous? Just write every single detail from the beginning to the end.
-- Then ask "Why did it happen?" - list down why did things go wrong? Were you not prepared? Did you go nervous? Someone made fun of you? Write it all.
-- Now is the time to ask "What is this trying to teach me?" - focus on the learnings, focus on what mistakes you shouldn't make in future. highlight your strengths, address your weaknesses by accepting and deciding that you can improve it
-- Bonus step - focus on the things you're grateful for.

In general, the first step is about collecting the details, second is for analysing, third is about focusing on your learnings and strengths, and bonus step is for promoting optimism and gratefulness.

This approach helps you spot patterns in your thoughts and reactions, leading to some seriously clear thinking.
And suddenly, the problems that felt insurmountable? They’re right there on the page, and often, so are the answers(yayyy). This clarity leads to better decisions and prevents your emotions from hijacking your rational brain. Plus, once you’ve done the root cause analysis of the problem that bothered you sometime back, you can consciously feed your brain the good stuff – positive affirmations, your goals, all the fuel to regain your sparkle. It’s like hitting the reset button and channeling your inner superhero. Trust me, it makes life a whole lot simpler and a whole lot more empowered!
